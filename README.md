<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this lab, I install Windows Server 2019 on a virtual machine, configure an two network adapters, add Active Directory Domain Services, Router Services, and DHCP Services.<br>
Additionally, we generate users using a list of names (text file) and PowerShell and add them to an Organizational Unit named `_USERS`
